For those situations it's oftentimes more convenient to be able to pay for the assistance you need, and get it right away. The following commercial KitchenCI support services are available to help:"

        - "Sometimes you just need to talk to an expert, or get some quick help to solve a problem. Contracts? <em>Ain't nobody got time for that!</em>"
        - "Incident Support is intended to provide just the right amount of support at just the right time -- now! Perhaps you're just getting started with KitchenCI and you want some advice on how to set things up in your environment, or maybe you've been using KitchenCI for a long time (or at a large scale) and you have encountered a unique problem - wouldn't it be nice if you could just talk to the experts? With KitchenCI Incident Support, now you can. Start with a 1-hour session - we'll get in touch with you ASAP and see if we can answer your question. If we decide that further involvement is necessary (and appropriate), additional time can be purchased on an as-needed basis."

Would it help satisfy your organizations business requirements to obtain a long-term support contract that provides certain assurances? KitchenCI Long-Term Support may be the answer for you. No matter what scale your organization is operating at, <a href='http://heavywaterops.com'>Heavy Water Operations</a> can offer an SLA to match. Inquire below to learn more."

We think that's great! But it's also not the same as support, so we prefer to channel those projects through our traditional professional services at <a href='http://heavywaterops.com'>Heavy Water Operations</a>. Contact us there and we'll be happy to help however we can."

While the KitchenCI community continues to increase in number on a monthly basis, most of the core contributions are still reviewed and managed by the the <a href=http://heavywaterops.com/people#team>Heavy Water Operations team</a>. While we do make an effort to stay actively involved in the community we still can't keep up with all the reqeusts we get. However, once we do our efforts usually result in a new KitchenCI release, which benefits everyone who is interested in KitchenCI. If you would like to sponsor these efforts, please check the box entitled 'Sponsor KitchenCI OSS' at checkout to contribute $500.00 towards OSS development<sup>#</sup>."
        - "We love our sponsors! As evidence of that, sponsors will be promoted on the <a href='http://kitchen.ci'>kitchen.ci</a> website, as well as through our social media outlets (currently <a href='http://twitter.com/kitchenci'>Twitter</a>; more coming soon!). Don't worry though - we won't publish anything without prior approval. If you opt to make a contribution at checkout time we'll contact you to inquire about how and where you would like to have your sponsorship published (if at all)."

      subheading: "If I purchase more time than I need, can I use it later?"
      desc:
        - "Yes! Hourly incident support can be used on an as-needed basis (e.g. if you purchase 5 hours and we only use 3 today, you may use the remaining 2 hours at a later time). However, we do ask that you use the time within 30 days (i.e. technically, they expire after 30 days. But if it's 'day 31' and you need help - <em>and you ask really nicely</em> - we probably won't turn you away)."

If you require 24/7/365 support please <a href='mailto:support@kitchen.ci?subject=Enterprise%20KitchenCI%20Support'>contact us directly</a> and we'll look forward to speaking with you."

        - "Response windows represent our commitment to responding to support requests in a timely manner. We will always respond to support requests as quickly as possible (sometimes on the same day, but always in the order in which they are received). However, please note that response times are not the same as <em>resolution times</em>; resolution times will be established as we begin to collect more information about your incident."
