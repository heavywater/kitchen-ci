  heading: "What is Test Kitchen?"
  content:
    - Test Kitchen is a test harness tool to execute your configured code on one or more platforms in isolation. A driver plugin architecture is used which lets you run your code on various cloud providers and virtualization technologies such as [Amazon EC2](https://rubygems.org/gems/kitchen-ec2), [Blue Box](https://rubygems.org/gems/kitchen-bluebox), [CloudStack](https://rubygems.org/gems/kitchen-cloudstack), [Digital Ocean](https://rubygems.org/gems/kitchen-digitalocean), [Rackspace](https://rubygems.org/gems/kitchen-rackspace), [OpenStack](https://rubygems.org/gems/kitchen-openstack), [Vagrant](https://rubygems.org/gems/kitchen-vagrant), [Docker](https://rubygems.org/gems/kitchen-docker), [LXC containers](https://rubygems.org/gems/kitchen-lxc), and more. Many testing frameworks are already supported out of the box including [Bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats), [shUnit2](https://code.google.com/p/shunit2/), [RSpec](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec), [Serverspec](http://serverspec.org/), with others being created weekly.
    - For Chef workflows, cookbook dependency resolver tools such as [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/) and [Librarian-Chef](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef) are supported or you can simply have a `cookbooks/` directory and Test Kitchen will know what to do. Support for Test Kitchen is already included in many Chef community cookbooks such as the [MySQL](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql), [nginx](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nginx), [Chef Server](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-server), and [runit](https://github.com/hw-cookbooks/runit) cookbooks.

    heading: "What will it give me?"
    content:
      - Test Kitchen has a simple workflow that stresses speed but optimizes for the freshness of your code executing on the remote systems between tests. It has a static, declarative configuration in a .kitchen.yml file at the root of your project. It is designed to execute isolated code run in pristine environments ensuring that no prior state exists. A plugin architecture gives you the freedom to run your code on any cloud, virtualization, or bare metal resources and allows you to write acceptance criteria in whatever framework you desire.
