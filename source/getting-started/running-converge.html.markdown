## Running Kitchen Converge

Now that we have some code, let's let Test Kitchen run it for us on our Ubuntu 12.04 instance:

```

```

To quote our Chef run, that **was** too easy. If you are a Chef user then part of the output above should look familiar to you. Here's what happened at a high level:

* Chef was installed on the instance by performing an [Omnibus pacakge installation](http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/)
* Your Git cookbook files and a minimal Chef Solo configuration were built and uploaded to the instance
* A Chef run was initiated using the run-list and node attributes specified in the `.kitchen.yml` file

There's nothing to stop you from running this command again (or over-and-over for that matter) so, let's see what happens:

```

```

That ran a **lot** faster didn't it? Here's what heppened this time:

* Test Kitchen found that Chef was present and installed so skipped a re-installation.
* The same Chef cookbook files and Chef Solo configuration was uploaded to the instance. Test Kitchen is optimizing for **freshness of code and configuration over speed**. Although we all like speed wherever possible.
* A Chef run is initiated and runs very quickly as we are in the desired state.

  <p>A lot of time and effort has gone into ensuring that the exit code of Test Kitchen is always appropriate. Here is the Kitchen Command Guarentee:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I will always exit with code <strong>0</strong> if my operation was successful.</li>
    <li>I will always exit with a non-zero code if <strong>any</strong> part of my operation was not successful.</li>
    <li>Any behavior to the contrary <strong>is a bug</strong>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This exit code behavior is a funamental prerequisite for any tool working in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment.</p>
</div>

Let's check the status of our instance:

```
$ kitchen list
Instance             Driver   Provisioner  Last Action
default-ubuntu-1204  Vagrant  Chef Solo    Converged
```

A clean converge run, success! Let's commit our production code and move on:

```
$ git add recipes/default.rb
$ git commit -m "Implemented the default recipe, woot woot."
[master a333057] Implemented the default recipe, woot woot.
