READMORE

Happy Friday! A quick release today to address an [issue](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/issues/580) that was reported shortly after 1.3.0 went out the door. Given that was a straight up bug, it seemed like a good idea to remedy it as soon as possible.

In the meantime, the Readme was [upgraded](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/pull/579) with some pretty [SVG badgess](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/blob/master/README.md#test-kitchen).

Thank you to Mike Fiedler and Torben Knerr for your attention to detail, and accuracy!
